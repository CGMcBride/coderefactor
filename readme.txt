The point execirse was to take the code from a website to make it more accsseiable 
I had to replace the div tags to nav, section, summary ect.
These are what we call semantic tags that way people can know where everything is 
in the website.

I removed the code that was repeating and I made easier to read while still
allowing the website to keep the same look.
